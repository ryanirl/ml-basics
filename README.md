# ML-BASICS

Sorry, this repo is a mess, but I do plan on cleaning it up once I get my bearings in ML :) 

I am teaching myself various machine learning techniques and plan on building everything I can from scratch.
I also plan on including all of the math associated with each.

Logistic Regression TODO
 - Add Cost Function

Known Problems
 - Jupyter Notebook equations aren't working in perceptron algorithm

Plan on Adding
 - Regression "stuff"
 - Support Vector Machines (SVM's) & Kernal Methods
 - Naive Bayes
 - SVM "FROM SCRATCH"
 - CVXOPT Optimization of SVM with Gaussian Kernal
 - SVM for MNIST classification (kinda from scratch)
