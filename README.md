*Currently Working On:* mnist Classification with SVM

Sorry, this repo is a mess, but I do plan on cleaning it up once I get my bearings :)
 
Known problems to look into
 - mnist classification with gaussian kernel takes hours to compute the gram matrix, looking into cuda gpu acceleration to speed it up.
 
Add to each:
 - Interactive Stuff
 - Cost Functions & Accuracy

## Road Map:

### Supervised Learning
1. Classification
    - Logistic Regression
    - SVM
        - mnist with "from scratch" SVM
    - Naive Bayes
    - KNN
    - Decision Trees
   
2. Regression
    Good List: https://www.listendata.com/2018/03/regression-analysis.html
    - Linear Regression
    - Polynomial Regression
    - Ridge / Lasso Regression
    - PLR
    - PLS
    
### Unsupervised Learning
1. Clustering
    - K-Means
    - ...
    
### Reinforcement Learning
1. ???
    
### Neural Networks and Deep Learning
1. Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN)
2. Convultional Neural Nets (CNN)
3. Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN)
4. ...

### Ensemble Learning 
1. Boosting
