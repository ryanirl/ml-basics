## K Means


K Means seems to get stuck in local minima a lot if you get unlucky with the
random initialization of the K clusters. One attempt to solve this would be to
pick smarter initalizations of your clusters using something like the KMeans++ 
algorithm. For 2D data with 2 clusters it seems to work everytime, though when
increasing the dimensions and clusters it seems to get stuck in local minima 
more and more often.
