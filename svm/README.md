# SVM

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** 

**1.** This implimentation/guide assumes a pretty advanced knowledge of SVM's already. More
specifically, it will assume all knowledge of these notes:

**2.** Please message me with any questions or bugs regarding this notebook, I
will tag your github at the bottom of the notebook if "noteable" bugs are
found.
